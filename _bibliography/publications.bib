  abstract   = {This paper presents a fully explicit coupled wave–vegetation interaction model capable of efficiently solving the coupled wave dynamics and flexible vegetation motion with large deflections. The flow model is formulated using the continuity equation and linearized momentum equations of an incompressible fluid, with additional terms within the canopy region accounting for the presence of vegetation. This linearized flow solver is unconditionally stable and second-order accurate. The flow model is validated and verified against experimental measurements and analytical solutions for waves over a rigid canopy, demonstrating its capability to accurately capture the wave dissipation and flow velocity profiles, even with a relatively coarse grid. A truss-spring model is proposed to capture vegetation motion with substantial deflections, and is proven to be mathematically consistent with the governing equation for the flexible vegetation motion. It allows for explicit time integration with large time steps when dealing with highly compliant vegetation. The truss-spring model is validated and verified by experimental and numerical results for large-amplitude motions of a single elastic blade subjected to waves and sinusoidal oscillatory flows. The coupled model, combining the linearized flow solver and the truss-spring model, is applied to investigate wave propagating over a heterogeneous, suspended, and flexible canopy, showing high efficiency and good agreement with the experiments concerning wave attenuation and the hydrodynamic loads on the vegetation.},

  abstract   = {An analytical framework is presented to describe the attenuation of regular and irregular waves propagating over floating seaweed farms. Kelp blades suspended on longlines are modelled, as a first approximation, as rigid bars rotating around their upper ends. Assuming small-amplitude blade motions under low to moderate sea conditions, the frequency-dependent transfer function of the rotations can be obtained, with quadratic drag loads linearized. Subsequently, the hydrodynamic problem with regular waves propagating over suspended seaweed canopies is formulated using the continuity equation and linearized momentum equations with additional source terms in the vegetation region. Analytical solutions are obtained for attenuated regular waves with their heights decaying exponentially as they propagate over the canopy. These solutions are utilized as the basis for predicting wave attenuation of irregular waves while stochastic linearization of the quadratic drag loads is employed. In contrast to energy-conservation-based models, which assume the velocity profile follows linear wave theory, the present solution can predict the reduced velocity inside the canopy. The analytical solutions are validated against experimental data and verified against a numerical flow solver. The model is capable of resolving the wave attenuation, along with velocity profiles and phase lag. Drag and inertial force exhibit cancellation effects on wave decay and both affect phase lag.},

  abstract  = {This article presents a numerical scheme for two-phase flows consisting of compressible gas and incompressible liquid. Assuming that the gas density is determined by pressure only and that the liquid density is constant, we develop a new set of governing equations for compressible–incompressible two-phase flows, which can be seen as a simplification of the previous unified governing equations. The volume fraction of gas, velocity, and pressure are the primary variables. Given the liquid's usual leading role in the flow motion, a pressure-based method is employed to solve the equations. A fifth-order accurate weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme is applied to discretize the advection terms, and the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing (THINC) scheme is utilized to capture the interface. The numerical scheme proposed is validated against the generalized Bagnold model and the free drop of a water patch in a closed tank. The results show that the scheme can tackle low Mach number compressible–incompressible two-phase flows. For the one-dimensional Bagnold model, the present numerical model achieves first-order convergence and gives better results than that based on the previous unified governing equations with the same numerical methods. In the simulation of the free drop of a water patch in a closed tank, a similar pressure curve with other reported work is given.},
